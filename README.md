# Machine Learning project - Heart Disease prediction

Data set source: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

The data set describes a classification problem in which our goal is to predict whether an individual has an heart disease or not based on the following features.

**Attribute information:**
* Age: Age of the patient [years]
* Sex: Sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
* ChestPainType: [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
* RestingBP: Resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
* Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
* FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
* RestingECG: Resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
* MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
* ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
* Oldpeak: ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
* ST_Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
* HeartDisease: Output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
